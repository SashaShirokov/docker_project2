In this project we are planning to download about 10-15 images of high resolution in two different ways: using threading and multiprocessing.
Each type is going to have its own container and one more container will make requests to them to get the information about time it took to download the images.
So the project is going to consist of three parts:
- thread
- process
- result

I'm going to add one part at a time. The init commit will be together with the first part thread.
